# Blackout Defender

This is a different approach to [DUAS](https://github.com/sujaldev/duas) (which I feel I've overcomplicated), in this
version a laptop will be used to detect power outages based on whether the laptop is on battery power or not. ~~Since
one already has to keep a laptop forever on for this, it'll be a good idea to use the laptop screen to display various
data about the server.~~ I'm ditching the TUI part because textual doesn't look as good in a virtual console (don't
know the exact name, the ones that open on `Ctrl+Alt+F1-F9`).

> **Note** If it isn't obvious, you have to keep the laptop plugged in, otherwise there's no way to tell if there's
> a power outage or not.
