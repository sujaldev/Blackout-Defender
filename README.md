# Blackout Defender

This is a different approach to [DUAS](https://github.com/sujaldev/duas) (which I feel I've overcomplicated), in this
version a laptop will be used to detect power outages based on whether the laptop is on battery power or not. Since one
already has to keep a laptop forever on for this, it'll be a good idea to use the laptop screen to display various data
about the server.

> **Note** If it isn't obvious, you have to keep the laptop plugged in, otherwise there's no way to tell if there's
> a power outage or not.
